# Github Actions Intro to Workflows

Create a GitHub Actions workflow that will trigger on every push to the **`main`** branch of your repository. The workflow should have jobs and steps that do the following:

Job 1:  Simple echo statements
1. Use the **`echo`** command to print a custom message.
2. Run a multi line script to output more statements

Job 2:  Run a bash script
1. Create a bash script
2. Run the bash script
(this may require additional steps; troubleshoot as needed using the Github Actions UI)

Job 3:  Run a Python script

Job 4:  Create your own job using atleast 2 steps that weren't used in the previous jobs
